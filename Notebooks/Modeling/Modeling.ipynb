    "* **Data Preprocessing:** Convert the high_level_ingredients list to a single string and combine relevant features into a single text column.\n",
    "* **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Transform the combined text features into numerical vectors.\n",
    "* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the TF-IDF vectors.\n",
    "* **Clustering:** Apply KMeans clustering to group similar recipes.\n",
    "* **Neural Network Training:** Train a neural network to predict the cluster of a recipe based on its features.\n",
    "* **Similarity Calculation:** Implement a function to find and return recipes similar to a given target recipe, weighting the similarity scores by ratings.\n"

    "* **Data Preparation:**\n",
    "  * High-Level Ingredients: Convert the high_level_ingredients lists into strings for easier processing.\n",
    "  * Feature Combination: Combine category, diet type, and high-level ingredients into a single text column.\n",
    "* **TF-IDF Vectorization:**\n",
    "  * Purpose: Transform the combined text features into numerical vectors that represent the importance of each term in the dataset.\n",
    "  * Technique: Use the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer to create a matrix of features.\n",
    "* **Dimensionality Reduction:**\n",
    "  * Purpose: Reduce the complexity of the TF-IDF matrix while preserving essential information.\n",
    "  * Technique: Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the TF-IDF matrix to 50 components.\n",
    "* **Clustering:**\n",
    "  * Purpose: Group similar recipes together to facilitate efficient and relevant recommendations.\n",
    "  * Technique: Use KMeans clustering to divide the dataset into 25 clusters based on the reduced feature set.\n",
    "* **Neural Network for Similarity Learning:**\n",
    "  * Purpose: Learn to predict the cluster membership of recipes, which helps in finding similar recipes.\n",
    "  * Architecture:\n",
    "    * Input Layer: 50-dimensional input corresponding to the PCA components.\n",
    "    * Hidden Layers: Two dense layers with 128 and 64 neurons, respectively, using ReLU activation.\n",
    "    * Output Layer: 25 output neurons with softmax activation to predict cluster probabilities.\n",
    "  * Compilation: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "* **Model Training:**\n",
    "  * Data: The PCA-transformed features are used as input (X), and the cluster labels are one-hot encoded as targets (y).\n",
    "  * Training: The model is trained over 25 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a validation split of 20%.\n",
    "* **Recipe Recommendation Function:**\n",
    "  * Purpose: Generate similar recipe recommendations based on a given recipe.\n",
    "  * Process:\n",
    "    * Find Target Cluster: Predict the cluster of the given recipe using the neural network.\n",
    "    * Calculate Similarities: Use cosine similarity to find recipes within the same cluster.\n",
    "    * Diversification (Optional): Adjust similarity scores to promote diversity in recommendations.\n",
    "    * Top Recommendations: Select the top N similar recipes, optionally diversified.\n",
